# RealEstate_Price_Analysis-PowerBi
This project analyzes 12,000 real estate listings across six metro cities, focusing on factors such as location, property size, number of bedrooms, and available amenities. The dataset is cleaned and structured to extract meaningful insights into pricing trends and property valuation.

Using Power BI, interactive dashboards and visualizations are created to explore price distributions, regional variations, and the impact of different property features on pricing. Data modeling and DAX calculations are applied to enhance analysis accuracy and insights.

This project demonstrates expertise in data visualization, Power BI, and analytical skills, helping users understand real estate market trends and make informed decisions.
